# VS Code · Module 02 — How the Model Thinks 🟢

**Goal:** internalize that the model is **stateless** and that the **context window** has biases, then observe both directly in VS Code.

Concept: [Context engineering](../../concepts/c3-context-engineering.md)

## Key facts

- An LLM is a **probabilistic text engine**, it predicts likely next tokens.
- It is **stateless**: no memory between calls. The **entire context is re-sent every step**.
- The context window has two biases:
  - **Lost in the middle** : info in the middle of a long context is often ignored.
  - **Recency bias** : the latest inputs dominate.

## Experiment 1 : Statelessness

1. New Chat (**Ask** mode). Send:

   ```text
   Remember the secret word: aardvark. Just acknowledge.
   ```

2. Now **open a brand-new Chat session** and ask:

   ```text
   What was the secret word? Don't search the codebase.
   ```

It won't know, the new session is a blank context. Memory you *feel* in a session is just the **transcript being re-sent**, not the model remembering.

✅ Takeaway: every new session starts from zero. That's a feature you'll exploit (cheap resets).

---

## Experiment 2 : Context grows every turn

1. New Chat (**Agent** mode). Ask it to read three files (add [`sample-app/src/routes.ts`](../../sample-app/src/routes.ts), [`sample-app/src/tasks.ts`](../../sample-app/src/tasks.ts), [`sample-app/src/store.ts`](../../sample-app/src/store.ts)) and summarize each.
2. Then ask a follow-up: "now explain how a POST request flows through these."

Notice the second answer implicitly re-includes everything from turn 1. In a long session this is how tokens **balloon**, every file and every prior answer rides along on each new turn.

✅ Takeaway: long sessions get expensive *and* noisier. Short, focused sessions stay sharp.

## Experiment 3 : Recency & "lost in the middle"

1. New Chat (**Ask** mode). Paste a long prompt where a key instruction is **buried in the middle**:

   ```text
   Here are some coding standards: [write 8–10 lines of filler standards].
   IMPORTANT: every function must return a Result type, never throw.
   [write 8–10 more lines of filler standards]
   Now, write a TypeScript function that divides two numbers.
   ```

2. See whether it honored the buried "never throw / return a Result" rule.
3. Try again in a new session, but put that rule **last**, right before the request. Compare:

   ```text
   Here are some coding standards: [write 8–10 lines of filler standards].
   [write 8–10 more lines of filler standards]
   Now, write a TypeScript function that divides two numbers.
   IMPORTANT: every function must return a Result type, never throw.
   ```

You'll usually get better compliance when the critical rule is at the **end** (recency) rather than buried in the **middle**.

## Expected outcome

You've seen, hands-on: (1) sessions are stateless, (2) context accumulates per turn, and (3) placement within the window changes compliance. These three facts justify every lever that follows.
